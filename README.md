# A Responsive HTML Table made with CSS Flexbox & Grid

The main unique feature of this data-table is it shifts position of the columns to different location based on the screen sizes. So the user will see three different UI for desktop, tablet, and mobile view instead of either squashed or horizontal scrollbar which are very ugly to look at. See the below screenshots for better understandings.
